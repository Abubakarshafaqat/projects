🎯 Objective
Apply data preprocessing (cleaning, noise reduction, integration) using the Titanic dataset in Python.

 ✅ Techniques Applied
## Data Cleaning
- Handled missing `Age` with median
- Filled `Embarked` with most frequent value
- Dropped `Cabin` due to many missing entries

### Noisy Data
- Used binning to categorize `Age` into logical groups

### Data Integration
- Performed correlation analysis between `Age`, `Fare`, and `Survived`

## 🛠️ Tools
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
